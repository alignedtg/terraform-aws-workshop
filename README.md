# Getting Started with Terraform and AWS

Welcome to the "Getting Started with Terraform and AWS" workshop!

The aim of this workshop is to teach you the fundamental concepts of using Terraform and provide you with the resources needed to continue your cloud automation journey.

To participate, you will need Terraform, an AWS account, and a way to write your Terraform configuration (e.g. VSCode). Optionally, you can also install the AWS CLI. You can download these tools from the following links:

- Terraform: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads
- AWS CLI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
- VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads

If you don't want to install Terraform on your computer, you can install it in the AWS CloudShell by executing the commands below in your CloudShell:
```bash
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.4.4/terraform_1.4.4_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_1.4.4_linux_amd64.zip
mkdir ~/bin
mv terraform ~/bin
```

One of the advantages of using CloudShell is that your credentials are already built-in.

Here's what you can expect to learn during the workshop:

- An overview of Terraform
- Understanding the Terraform workflow
- Understanding providers and modules
- Building the config

To learn more about Terraform, you can refer to the following resources:

Terraform Docs: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs
Terraform Registry: https://registry.terraform.io/

I hope you find this workshop informative and valuable. Happy learning!
